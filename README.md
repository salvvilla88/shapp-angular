This is a basic front end that plots points in a scatterplot, by manually inputting the data in the interface and via a JSON file. It was created based on requirements from the Foundation I was doing my social hours in. They requested I create it in Angular and I had never used this framework before and had little experience with JS, used both my general programming knowledge, research, and ChatGPT to create it.
